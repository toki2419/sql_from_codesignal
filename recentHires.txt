Your company has many different departments. Information about the employees working in these departments is stored in the pr_department, it_department, and sales_department tables, which have the following structures:

pr_department:
id: the unique (for this department) employee ID;
name: the name of the employee;
date_joined: the date this employee was hired by your company.
it_department:
id: the unique (for this department) employee ID;
name: the name of the employee;
date_joined: the date this employee was hired by your company.
sales_department:
id: the unique (for this department) employee ID;
name: the name of the employee;
date_joined: the date this employee was hired by your company.
Your task is to prepare a report that has the names of all the employees who were hired recently.

Given the pr_department, it_department, and sales_department tables, compose the result as follows: The resulting table should have one column names that contains the names of the last five people to join each department. 
The names of the employees from the pr_department should come first, followed by the it_department, and the sales_department will come last. 
The names of employees who work in the same department should be sorted in ascending order.
